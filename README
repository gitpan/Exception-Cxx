=head1 NAME

  Exception::Cxx - Switch to ANSI C++ exceptions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Exception::Cxx;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module install arranges for perl to use ANSI C++ exceptions
(instead of C<setjmp>/C<longjmp>).  The reason you might want this is
for integration with 3rd party libraries that already make use of C++
exceptions.
